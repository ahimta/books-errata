This approach means that the process to design our code is more like one of guided evolution, with each small step giving us feedback, but not necessarily yet adding up to a whole feature. This is a very challenging change of perspective for many people, but it is a liberating step when embraced and is one that has a positive impact on the quality of our designs.

True that incremental small changes is an excellent approach but there are others like feature-fags/branching-by-abstraction.

Another use for feature-flags is things like gradual rollout. This and more is available in LaunchDarkly.

But it's important to keep in mind that it's always better to define errors out of existence.

Unnecessarily using different formats/units has an inherent cost that can't be avoided even with ports/adapters.

As an example, many systems can use meters/seconds in most of the project.

Because we made our code testable, it is now more flexible. Creating a BetterCar with a PetrolEngine is simple, but so is creating a BetterCar with an ElectricEngine or a FakeEngine or even, if we are a bit crazy, a JetEngine. Our BetterCar is better code, and it is better code because we focused on making it easier to test.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Note - 14 The Tools of an Engineering Discipline >  Page 192
</div>
<div class="noteText">
But this is unnecessary complexity when only a single engine is used and it's much better for clients to not even know that a car uses an engine.

As I said, this point applies most when only a single engine is needed and adding unused flexibility everywhere in a project can be surprisingly very expensive as it's a cost without any value.

Another caveat is that, even with parametarizing the engine, some important internal behavior is still untested. This is an excellent example of a cost for something that doesn't achieve the desired result.

So another issue here, which may not always be avoidable, is that the `Car` API is what I call confidential where it can't be tested merely by using its public interface.

And thus I find the first choice is to always make the API non-confidential and avoid the need for mocking to test it effectively.

The issues of confidential APIs may indicate something like missing auditability/understandability and make mocking and other testing techniques unnecessarily needed.

Many APIs may still need mocking/dependency-injection but the biggest issue I find most people struggle with is what to mock/dependency-inject and what to not to. And so little of the literature (incl. this book) seem to give this key-point its due attention.

This, and much worse, can happen if you can't do TDD effectively and it's much much better in this cases to not do it.

Programming is a means to an end and if you can't use any approach effectively then you should use other ones even if they're worse.

This applies to more than just TDD. The biggest issue in many human endeavors isn't MISSING CAPABILITY but rather MISMATCHED CAPABILITY WITH GOALS.

I have seen too many times excellent teams fail miserably because their skills get abused with goals much bigger than their skills/capability.

On the other hand, I've seen many mediocre teams succeed brilliantly because they're used more strategically with respect to their skills/capability.

You might argue that this is outside the scope of this book but then I'd argue the book can very easily wreck projects for many readers.

Saying all this, I agree almost completely (which is very rare for me) with you from a technical perspective. But there are prerequisites for this and I'd be happy to list them for you in the future if you want.

Outcomes vs. Mechanisms
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Note - 15 The Modern Software Engineer >  Page 210
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Different people have different opinions/perspective and very few have any real flexibility and would just like to follow some creed.

And indeed it may be best for many to follow a creed since they are, in a practical sense, inept and a reasonable creed is best for them.

This comes on how some people may be hung up on the mechanism/creed and they may use wrong arguments and some smart people may prove that mechanism is the outcome (means are the end) but provability/convensibility isn't correctness.

It's easier to focus in mechaisms rather than goals. At least that what most people think.

In reality, however, outcomes are easier and they maximize leverage. Focusing on mechanisms almost eliminates leverage and results in an almost fixed cost even with exceptional capabilities.

Another reason for focusing is a way of thinking that maybe impractical since two centuries ago. That's assuming it was ever practical.

It isn't about how much money/skill/knowledge/time you put in or doing something difficult. It's about the outcomes you can achieve and you want to achieve the best outcomes with the least difficulty/resources.

Regardless, we have to work with different people with different opinions/creeds and ahieve the best outcomes even if at the expense of focusing on mechanisms when we should be focusing on outcomes.

As for CD vs. DevOps I see them both as tools (just like almost everything). For example, if you're working on the wrong features with CD then it's mostly irrelevant.

Outcomes are mostly sacred and if an organization/person sees CD as an outcome then something is really wrong because it's ultimately a tool/mechanism and focusing on it can eliminate leverage.

Saying all this, I agree almost competely with you that CD is an excellent tool/mechanism and generally closer to outcomes than DevOps.

And in the end, there will always be new acronyms but the outcomes are constant and maybe only limited by very few constraints (e.g., ethics, law).
