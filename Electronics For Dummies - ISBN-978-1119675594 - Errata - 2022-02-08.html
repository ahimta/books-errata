Wouldn't "Serial" make more sense than "Serious" as the former is the opposite of parallel (e.g: serial/parallel port). Whereas the latter has no obvious relation to "parallel."

Of course, "Serious" would still be the best choice if this is the technical term.

Note - Beyond the Book >  Page 4
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Typo: "significant updates" and not "significate updates."

This typo is quite alarming as "significate" doesn't seem to be a word and a misspell checker should easily point this out.

The root-cause maybe how publishing houses, in general, make little use of simple automation that has a very high ROI.

For example, a program that takes a file as input and just indicated whether it's free of misspellings. Word processors are not good for this as an editor may not notice a highlighted misspelling and the book would be published with typos. The general idea is to have a book thoroughly checked by a single program for everything that software can check.

Pragmatic Press is a leader in this regard and others should follow suit as the opportunity cost is too great.
