<div class="noteText">
In this unit example, we’re using logger to send an entry to syslog and the journal. You read in Section 7.1.2 that you can view log messages by unit. However, the unit could finish up before journald has a chance to receive the message. This is a race condition, and in the case that the unit completes too quickly, journald won’t be able to look up the unit associated with the syslog message (this is done by process ID). Consequently, the message that gets written in the journal may not include a unit field, rendering a filtering command such as journalctl -f -u loggertest.service incapable of showing the syslog message. This isn’t normally a problem in longer- running services.

There’s one tricky detail in routing. Say the host wants to send something to 10.23.2.132, which matches both rules in a routing table, the default route and 10.23.2.0/ 24. How does the kernel know to use the second one? The order in the routing table doesn’t matter; the kernel chooses the longest destination prefix that matches. This is where CIDR notation comes in particularly handy: 10.23.2.0/ 24 matches, and its prefix is 24 bits long; 0.0.0.0/ 0 also matches, but its prefix is 0 bits long (that is, it has no prefix), so the rule for 10.23.2.0/ 24 takes priority.

For example, say your machine has an SSH server on TCP port 22. There’s no reason for any random host to initiate a connection to any other port on your machine, and you shouldn’t give any such host a chance. To set that up, first set the INPUT chain policy to DROP: # iptables -P INPUT DROP To enable ICMP traffic (for ping and other utilities), use this line: # iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT Make sure that you can receive packets you send to both your own network IP address and 127.0.0.1 (localhost).
