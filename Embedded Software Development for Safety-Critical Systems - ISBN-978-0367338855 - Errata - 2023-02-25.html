<div class="noteText">
The elusive nature of Heisenbugs make them particularly difficult to fix, and some researchers, particularly Andrea Borr (see, for example, reference [5]), have found that attempts to fix Heisenbugs generally make the situation worse than it was before. 
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Note - 2. Terminology of Safety >  Page 23
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Could be useful to mention some simple but very effective approaches for working with Heisenbugs.

For example, running the suspect part of the system 10s, 100s or more. This can be non-trivial but still more productive and less stressful than other techniques. This technique cost can also be amoterized over many tricky bugs.

But, in the end, the single most powerful technique is probably to cool down and assume a simple Bohrbug and only go the Heisenbug route as a last resort.

You seem to have quite the confrontational style. We probably need more people like this in this age where agreeableness abound.

However, IMHO, this straight-arrow style, although right, can backfire in the future and hurt in the long run and tempering one's word maybe of atmost importance.

You probably can agree with this in firsthand by how you feel right now while reading this note that isn't even that confrontational.

Very well said! As one quote says, paraphrasing here, "In theory practice doesn't matter, but in practice, it does."

I don't recall the book mentioning Rust and suspect it doesn't. But I think there's a strong argument to be made for handling as many concerns (e.g., some race-coditions at compile-time) in infrastructure. C/C++ can be thought of as some sort of heroics magnet.

One huge issue with C/C++ is that it's inherently unsafe that's, even with all the static/dynamic analysis tools, significant risk will always remain. And even if said risk were theoretically eliminated, seemingly trivial changes can reintroduce them.

This is relevant to a principle of mine: no amount of human effort can beat a computer for tasks (e.g., safer compilers/lantuages like Rust) that are tractable for computers and they're superior at.

This doesn't mean that Rust is always superior to C/C++ especially that the latter issues/risks are much more understood.

I'd close with this: maybe we should start thinking of languages' typesystems/safety along the same lines of their ability to handle syntax errors. For example, is it any different for someone to use C/C++ over Rust than using a programming language without a syntax checker over one with a syntax checker?!

Dynamic typing allows code to be more compact and, in particular, to have fewer conditional statements.

Some of the things you have to ensure are correct are the following:
1. Index manipulated correctly.

3. Correct combination of the above used correctly (more error-prone with nested loops).

Add to this the confusing cargo-cult behavior of avoiding mixed-declarations with C99+ and using i/j with multi-level instead of meaningful index-variable names.

This is unfortunately impossible. In the first case, it is impossible to specify what a program ought to do. Consider this snippet of C code and ask yourself whether it contains a fault: int y = 10; char x[8]; int z = 7; strcpy(x, "12345678"); Almost all programmers, and all static analysis tools, will immediately claim that there is a fault in the code: a beginner’s fault. The program copies 9 bytes (the 8-byte string “12345678” and its terminating zero) to a field only 8 bytes wide. Depending on how the compiler has laid out the stack, either y or z will be corrupted. This is true, but the purpose of the program was to allow the programmer to test an application for detecting and handling stack corruption— the program is doing exactly what it is intended to do in deliberately corrupting the stack. Without a formal definition of what the program is intended to do, it is impossible for either a human or a program to determine whether it is correct or not, and, generally, the only formal definition is the program itself.

Because, otherwise, 1% of warnings that can fail a system in weird scenarios can be buried in trivial warnings. This may even be an understatement as a machine can beat a world-class expert in syntactic/pedantic analysis.

And so error/warning free code (with suppressions where it's impractical) should be a baseline and, as a programmer practice this, their coding style changes and adapts to writing visibly correct code that machines can't complain about, humans don't need explanations for, and doesn't depend on far/global parts of a system to be correct or do things in a certain way that can easily change.

Should probably briefly explain "a posteriori" and maybe even contrast it with "a priori" as it's very little bother to those who know and very convenient for those who don't.

And, in general, it's super nice for books to be standalone, wherever practical.

A well-written, comparative, and simple analysis. It's quite impressive an example to be followed.

Expressing Doubt The basic GSN as defined in version 2 of the standard does not allow the analyst to express doubt. This restriction is removed if eliminative argumentation as described on page 330 is used. BBNs intrinsically allow doubt to be expressed.
