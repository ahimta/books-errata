The max integer-value in, both signed/unsigned and 2s-complement/others, isn't a multiple of 2 (the odd/1 bit is on).

Have you considered this here? The good thing is you can use the min-value that's 2s-complement/signed.

I think that the CERT C Standard book makes the same mistake too in a snippet of code!

It’s not obvious, especially today, why “memcpy” is more useful than fully spelling it out as “memcopy.” But there were probably multiple reasons for abbreviating things when Unix was created in the early 1970s, including storage space constraints

Another important reason was that some compilers/linkers only supported a maximum of 7 letters for exported symbols.

One other reason is that seeing short names everywhere (e.g: one letter command-line options) is very contagious.

Another reason is that most programmers (especially who aren't exposed to many different codebases) don't appreciate how expensive is unnecessary implicit understanding of the code, have never seen high-quality code in their life, or have high tolerance for accidental complexity.
