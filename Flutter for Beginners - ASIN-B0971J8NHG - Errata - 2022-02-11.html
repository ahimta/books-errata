Quite the opposite as they introduce the unnecessary possibility of using the wrong collection, the wrong index, or both.

This is especially true for nested loops and if there's no errors (warning are insufficient as they can easily be ignored or not noticed if there are many of them) for shadowing or unused variables.

These are glaring issues that are not mentioned enough because, ironically, we don't hear them mentioned enough.

But we should always do what's best and not just follow the herd as what's beneficial to them might be harmful to us and vice-versa.

This seems to be a dangerous lax behavior that can cause the programmer to accidentally have a variable `dynamic` and only discover this after hours of debugging or more if this lax behavior causes errors in production under some special scenarios.

This lax behavior is what static typing should protect against. Warnings still aren't sufficient in this case and dynamic variables should at least only be allowed explicitly.

Should probably mention at least very briefly what would happen if the variable is used before it's initialized. Again because not all readers read the whole book.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Variables and data types >  Page 90

<div class="noteText">
To solve this problem, Dart has the late type modifier. This tells Dart that you are completely confident that at the point the variable's value is accessed, the variable will have already been set to a value. Let's update the example to show that in action, as follows: late int newNumber; // newNumber type allows nullability
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Note - Variables and data types >  Page 90
</div>
<div class="noteText">
The comment about nullability is probably wrong and just copied from the previous snippet.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Variables and data types >  Page 91
</div>
<div class="noteText">
To solve this problem, you can explicitly check if the variable is null and only access the value if it is not null. If it is not null, then Dart remembers this and will treat the variable as if it is no longer nullable.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Note - Variables and data types >  Page 91
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Should probably mention that it's safe to use nullable variables after checking as Dart is single-threaded and its isolates share data only through message-passing communication.

And it would be nice to have map/foreach functions for optionals.

<div class="noteText">
Dart is a type- safe programming language, which means that when the code is written and compiled, each variable must have a defined type. This is in contrast to languages such as JavaScript where the variable's type is not defined and can change while the code is running. This can lead to issues at runtime, where the expected type of a variable doesn't match the actual type.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Note - Variables and data types >  Page 94

Type-safe seems to be used here as statically-typed.

And the note about the type changing accidentally probably applies to Dart, with implicitly/accidentally `dynamic` variables, and is even more pernicious than with JS (at least you'd be on your guard with JS).

Shadowing definitions is quite dangerous and can lead to bugs that can take days to find. This should probably be an error as there's little value in shadowing and big risks.

If shadowing is allowed then C is safer in this aspect as the compiler allows you to make this an error.

Immutability Most programming languages refer to the term "immutable." An immutable object is an object that never changes. That is, it cannot change itself, and it cannot be changed externally. Instead, if a change is needed, then the object is simply replaced. A stateless widget is immutable because it cannot change its properties or state, nor can something external change its properties or state. If the widget needs to change, then it is effectively replaced by a new widget that has different properties or state.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">

However, there are a few reasons why you might choose to include a trailing comma. Firstly, adding items to a list is easier if there is already a comma present.

This is a great example of the risk of manually editing files: it's easy to add non-existing packages or versions and only notice the failure later.

In general, manual editing should only be used as a last resort for operations that can't easily be automated. Because commands can do all necessary checks and only edit files if all of the checks pass.

The command can also perform all the necessary steps and changes which even if it's a single change or step can change in the future.

The morale of the story is that commands/automation/software should do almost everything and humans only when this isn't possible (e.g: there's an inherent ambiguity) or expensive to implement in software.

A `switch` would probably make more sense here.

For example, it would make it immediately clear that not all errors (that exist right now or added in the future) are handled.

Code in books, even for such simple snippets, should be bullet-proof for many reasons (more than a dozen). One of which is that it produces a better generation of programmers.

There are a couple of gotchas, though, that are worth being aware of. These are described here:
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Note - Exploring Firebase plugins >  Page 350
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Static/dynamic typing for fields not mentioned.

For example, are they all stringified internally in the Firestore.

</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Note - Exploring Firebase plugins >  Page 350
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Does this include boolean fields too?

This maybe strange as they wouldn't be much useful because they have low cardinality. But it could be the case that Firestore has optimized boolean indexes that work well.

<div class="noteText">
The Firestore is probably more fit to be called `firebase_database` and the realtime DB could be `firebase_realtime_database`.

The confusing names are probably for historical reasons (which isn't much of an excuse as it can be used for infinite mistakes/confusions). Whatever the reason, this should be mentioned in the book or the author should provide a reason for not clarifying confusion outside their control.

This note, naturally, extends to APIs too. And as they say, the best time to do something is 20years and the 2nd best time is now.

Not clear whether the value of `versionCode` is taken from the major version or last version-component after the `+`.

And wouldn't it be better to just increment `versionCode` and its equivalent in iOS each time. 

This can be useful. For example, Android probably prevent users from installing/updating a build with an older `versionCode`.

Should probably add a proper extension for `DESTINATION_FILEPATH` so that it's easy to tell when the reader see similar files.
