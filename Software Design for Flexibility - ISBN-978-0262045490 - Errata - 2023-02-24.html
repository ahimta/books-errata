Should also note that programming for performance can easily produce a slower system as optimization is often done incorrectly. For example, optimizing locally may slow the program in production for whatever reason.

Another more important point is that counter-productive optimization can be for concerns other than performance.

Especially in a book, it maybe best to write out each `let` leg/parameter/variable-definition in its own line. And even on a screen, it would make it much easier to scan the code and avoid forcing the reader to read each line from beginning to end.

And maybe remove nested let expressions and define variables in parent let if it allows later variables to use preceding ones.

What's with the cryptic naming? Much better naming can easily be used and be self descriptive. For exampe, here's one approach for replacing cryptic names:
dot: char
bol: beginning-of-line
eol: end-of-line
quote: exact or string
alt: or and "and" can be added if needed

Adding insult to injury, when this regular expression is put into a Scheme string, it is necessary to quote each backslash character with another backslash.

If such checks fail, the wrapper can raise an error signal. This “paranoid programming style” is a very powerful tool for protecting a system from misuse and for debugging.

And for ensuring invariants are satisfied and the system doesn't get into an undefined state. Because if the programmer can't prevent the system from getting to an undefined, they probably can't achieve the harder task of running it correctly in an undefined state.

One important note is that this doesn't mean the the system is unavailable as it can restart. And even mitigate poison-pills with some added complexity if needed.

There are some notable exceptions: the functional programming extensions introduced by Java 8 directly capture useful combinations. Functional programming languages, such as Lisp and Haskell, have libraries of useful combination mechanisms.

The formal algebraic details were clarified by Hal Abelson around 1994, as part of an effort to fix a bug. The code was painfully reworked in 1997 by Sussman with the help of Hardy Mayer and Jack Wisdom.

I think a call-by-name (as contrasted by a call-by-value) is the terminology that's used in the Haskell community and maybe even the PL community.

And it could be useful to use this terminology too. Or at least mention the differences between the common terminology and the strict/non-strict terminology.

Important to stress the point for development/debugging where the program inputs are relatively small and there's plenty of space/time resources.

The same applies for assertions/pre-conditions/post-conditions. Which should be used in production too as a crash/system-graceful-shutdown is better than unexpected state/input/output which can cause much more damage.

GHC (the Haskell compiler) is one example of a multi-decade project with many great practices that are not very known but still very effective and intuitive. One of which is expensive assertions in development.

I'd expect this book to cover some of these in quite some depth as more evolvable code can be harder to develop. And without proper practices, trying to implement reasonably general implementations can fail and lead to bouncing back to overly specific implementations.
