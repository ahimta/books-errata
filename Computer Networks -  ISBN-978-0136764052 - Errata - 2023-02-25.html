Alice starts out by invoking the PGP program on her computer. PGP first hashes her message, P, using SHA-2, and then encrypts the resulting hash using her private RSA key, DA. When Bob eventually gets the message, he can decrypt the hash with Alice’s public key and verify that the hash is correct.

Intuitively, sign/verify instead of encrypt/decrypt would be used with the hash. Otherwise, this should be noted in all other cases to avoid confusion and, preferrably, provide a rationale if the non-intuitive encrypt/decrypt is indeed used.

The signature part contains a header, which will not concern us here. The header is followed by a timestamp, the identifier for the sender’s public key that can be used to decrypt the signature hash, some type information that identifies the algorithms used (to allow SHA-4 and RSA2 to be used when they are invented), and the encrypted hash itself.

More important than SHA4 and RSA2 is the support for any algorithm. Another option is to use protocol info instead of signature info and make it possible to not only change the algorithms but the whole protocol/format.

These new remailers, often called cypherpunk remailers, work as follows. The user produces an email message, complete with RFC 822 headers (except Fr om:, of course), encrypts it with the remailer’s public key, and sends it to the remailer.

Should mention that single re-mailers still have some serious issues, which are quite intuitive. For example, a compromized re-mailer that receives from the original sender directly can still save logs. This can happen either intentionally by the server owner or by a cracker who would make the server send it the logs. So both trust in the server's owner and the absence of crackers are something to be considered.

For a chain of re-mailers, the same applies but more parties have to be compromized. One caveat is that only compromizing the first and last maybe sufficient. Another point, that maybe reasonable to not mention here, is that chain re-mailers can be less secure in the field since their operators may percieve the overall system to be more secure or assume incorrectly that operators of other servers' security can make up for their mistakes (diffusion of responsibility).
